                    <p>The rain fell in sheets as I hurried down the deserted street, my collar turned up against the cold. I hadn't planned to be out this late, but the meeting had run longer than expected.</p>
                    
                    <p>That's when I saw him—a shadowy figure standing beneath the flickering streetlamp. He seemed to be waiting for someone. As I approached, he turned slowly to face me, and I caught a glimpse of pale, drawn features.</p>
                    
                    <p>"Excuse me," I muttered, quickening my pace. But as I passed, his hand shot out and grabbed my arm with surprising strength.</p>
                    
                    <p>"You can see me?" he whispered, his voice hoarse with disbelief.</p>
                    
                    <p>I froze. There was something in his eyes—a depth of sorrow that made my breath catch. "Of course I can see you," I replied, trying to keep my voice steady.</p>
                    
                    <p>His grip tightened. "No one has been able to see me for fifty years."</p>
                    
                    <p>The words hung between us as the rain continued to fall, and I realized with dawning horror that the streetlamp's light cast no shadow from the man before me.</p>
                `
            },

                content: `
                    <p>I tried to pull away, but his grasp was like iron. "Please," he begged, his voice cracking. "I need to tell someone what happened that night."</p>
                    
                    <p>Against my better judgment, I stopped resisting. The desperation in his voice was too genuine to ignore. "What night?" I asked.</p>
                    
                    <p>He looked around nervously, as if expecting someone to appear. "October 12th, 1972. The night I disappeared."</p>
                    
                    <p>A chill ran down my spine that had nothing to do with the rain. I knew that date—it was the same night the old mill on the edge of town had burned down, taking its night watchman with it.</p>
                    
                    <p>"You're... you're Henry Watkins," I breathed.</p>
                    
                    <p>His eyes widened. "You know my name?"</p>
                    
                    <p>"There's a plaque at the library," I said. "They thought you died in the fire."</p>
                    
                    <p>A bitter smile twisted his lips. "Oh, I died alright. But not in the fire. That was just the cover-up."</p>

                    <p>The street seemed to grow colder as he leaned closer. "I saw something I shouldn't have that night. Something that got me killed. And now I'm stuck here, unable to move on until the truth comes out."</p>
                    
                    <p>Thunder rumbled in the distance as I realized with growing certainty that this encounter was no accident. The question was—why me? And did I really want to get involved in a fifty-year-old mystery that had already claimed one life?</p>
                    
                    <p>But as I looked into Henry's haunted eyes, I knew the answer. Some stories demand to be told, no matter how much time has passed.</p>
                    
                    <p>"Tell me everything," I said, steeling myself for what was to come. "From the beginning."</p>
                    
                    <p>Henry nodded, his form flickering slightly like the streetlamp above us. "It started when I saw the mayor that night, with a briefcase full of cash..."</p>
                    
                    <p>The rain continued to fall as the ghost began his tale, and I knew my life would never be the same after this midnight confession.</p>
